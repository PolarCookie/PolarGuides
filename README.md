## Ding80GuidesAlliance.lua
Translated the Ding80 leveling guide to the Zygor syntax to work within the addon.  

### Edits done to Ding80
Auberdine added for lvl 19-20, instead of grinding mobs for an entire level.  
Cracking Maury's Foot and Mai'Zoth added.  
Desolace has been replaced by Arathi Highlands.  
Removed Foreman Razelcraz questline, not worth the hassle of stepping into horde territory, hellfire slightly reorganized because of this.  
Removed Withered Basidium, to much grind.  

### Progress
Dun Morogh 1-12 done  
Alliance 13-68 done  

### Class quest included
Warlocks learn voidwalker, succubus and felhunter along the way.  
Warriors get Berserker Stance and Whirlwind weapon.  

### Guide todo
**Vanilla**  
Do a timed run comparison of grinding lvl 19 in westfall or heading to auberdine as is written.  
If auberdine stays, tempted to add The Absent Minded Professor questline, it hooks into wetlands.  
Thelsamar blood sausage needs to be completed earlier, loss of xp due to gray.  
Make some waypoints inside Deadmines for Collecting memories and Oh brother...  
Clean up Forest Song quest start and end route.  
Add Bartolo's Yeti fur cloak.  
Add "Kill 'Em With Sleep Deprivation" and "Look at the Size of It!" when they are fixed in Trinity Core.  
Add druid water form questline, it fits into late westfall questing and it's written into Zygor's.  

## Ding80GuidesAllianceTBC.lua (TO BE ADDED)
Same as Ding80GuidesAlliance.lua, but edited for TBC. This shifts lvl 14 to go to Redrigde instead of 20, as no mount yet.
Also changes travel paths.

### Guide todo
Adjust Stormwind City and Eastern Plaguelands coordinates to TBC values.

## Ding80GuidesAllianceTBCduo.lua
Same as Ding80GuidesAllianceTBC.lua, but now it's tuned for 2 people leveling together, doing more quests and Deadmines, Stockades, Razorfen Kraul, Zul Farrak, Maraudon, Sunken Temple and Stratholme along the way. Outland dungeons are at your own leisure.  
This guide has a chapter called "TBC Gold Rush"; the idea is to maximize experience gainend in Azeroth before starting outland, in order to hit 70 earlier and get more gold from quests thereafter.  
Currently this guide starts in outland at around lvl 63.5.  

### Guide todo
Add Scholomance key questline and Scholomance itself.

# PANIC, MY QUESTS ARE GREEN!
Don't worry to much about that.  
Quest xp works like this.
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Quest Level</th>
		<th>Quest Color</th>
		<th>Quest XP</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>+5</td>
		<td>Red</td>
		<td>100%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>+3</th>
		<td>Orange</td>
		<td>100%</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</th>
		<td>Yellow</td>
		<td>100%</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>-3</th>
		<td>Green</td>
		<td>100%</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>-6</th>
		<td>Green</td>
		<td>80%</th>
	</tr>
</table>
I recommend getting an addon like Bayis Questlog addon, it shows the quest level in the log.
